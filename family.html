	<p>And this is my family.  My wife Tina and our daughter Cassidy. Also Santa, an elf, and what looks like Rudolf.  We keep busy with Cassidy, work, and school but we have a good time.  My biggest reason for trying to improve my postion further is these two.  I want them to be happy and for Cassidy to have a good start into the world and know that she can rely on us for anything.</p>
