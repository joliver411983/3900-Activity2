<h1 title="Jason's Activity 2 Webpage">Jason's Activity 2 Webpage</h1>

<p>Welcome to my Activity 2 webpage.  I have worked in IT for the past 15 years.  Starting in customer service and helpdesk and working my way up and through being a Systems and Storage Engineer.  I have worked with everything from basic end user software to virtualization environements.  I've never been a strong programmer but I have worked with programming departments to setup and work with version control systems. In the process I've had to learn enough to be able to read what they're doing.  Just never been one for putting things together from scratch.  This course should help change that!</p>
